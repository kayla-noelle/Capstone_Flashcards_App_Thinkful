# Capstone_Flashcards_App_Thinkful

## Overview
A React Project that reaches into backend JSON API server to retrieve information on decks and cards. You can create, read, update and delete decks and cards.

## Challenge
A full-stack application designed to test on us the front-end portion. Thinkful has already provided up with the backend built in. My task was to connect and make API calls using useEffect hooks to properly retrieve and show data on our frontend. I then stored the retrieved back-end information in state. Overall, this full-stack project was a great example of working with an existing codebase, while showcasing our front-end abilities.

## What I've learned 
This gave me a realistic insight on how to work with an existing database and how React in a full stack application works. This was more challenging than I expected because I had to make sure to create files with Links and nested Routers so the application was not overwhelmed.
